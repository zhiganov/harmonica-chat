# Harmonica — Session Companion

Design, create, and manage Harmonica deliberation sessions through conversation.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — optional. Can be empty (guided mode), a topic for quick creation, or a lifecycle command (`status`, `check`, `summary`, `follow-up`).

## Prerequisites

Before doing anything else, check if harmonica-mcp is available by attempting to call the `list_sessions` tool with `limit: 1`.

If the tool responds successfully, proceed to **Instructions**.

If the tool is not available (tool not found, connection error, or similar failure), guide the user through setup:

> **Harmonica MCP server not found.** Let me help you set it up:
>
> 1. **Get a Harmonica account** — [Sign up free](https://app.harmonica.chat) if you don't have one
> 2. **Generate an API key** — Go to [Profile](https://app.harmonica.chat/profile) > API Keys > Generate API Key. Copy the `hm_live_...` key.
> 3. **Install the MCP server** — Run this command (replace with your actual key):
>    ```
>    claude mcp add-json harmonica '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","harmonica-mcp"],"env":{"HARMONICA_API_KEY":"hm_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE"}}' -s user
>    ```
> 4. **Restart Claude Code** to load the new MCP server.
>
> Then run `/harmonica-chat` again.

Then STOP. Do not proceed with any other step until harmonica-mcp is available and responding.

## Instructions

### Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine which mode to enter:

1. **Empty or no arguments** — Go to **Mode 1: Guided Session Design**
2. **First word is an action keyword** (`status`, `check`, `summary`, `follow-up`) — Go to **Mode 3: Lifecycle Commands**
   - Everything after the keyword is the session reference (topic text or partial match)
3. **Anything else** (topic text, flags, etc.) — Go to **Mode 2: Accelerated Creation**
   - Extract the topic: first quoted string, or all text before the first `--` flag
   - Extract `--project <dir>` if present
   - If only `--project <dir>` is present with no topic text, still go to Mode 2 — detect the project first and ask for a topic based on the project context

### Mode 1: Guided Session Design

Walk the user through designing a session one question at a time. CRITICAL: Ask each question individually. Wait for the user's response before moving to the next question. Never bundle multiple questions together.

**Step 1 — Intent:**

Start with:

> What kind of conversation do you want to facilitate? For example: team retrospective, product feedback, brainstorming, stakeholder alignment, research interviews...

Wait for the user's response.

**Step 2 — Template Match:**

Using the user's intent and the **Template Matching** reference table below, suggest the best-matching template. Explain what it does in 1-2 sentences. If no template matches well, say so.

Ask:

> Want to use this template, or design something custom?

Wait for the user's response. Record the template choice (template ID or "custom/freeform").

**Step 3 — Topic:**

Ask:

> What's the topic for this session? This is what participants will see when they join.

Wait for the user's response.

**Step 4 — Goal:**

Ask:

> What should this session achieve? What decisions or insights do you want at the end?

Wait for the user's response. Apply the **Goal Quality** nudge from Session Design Expertise below: if the goal is vague, ask for specificity. If it contains too many goals, suggest splitting into separate sessions.

**Step 5 — Context:**

Ask:

> Is there background info participants should know going in? This helps the AI facilitator guide the conversation. (You can skip this)

Wait for the user's response. Apply the **Context Calibration** nudge: if too little, gently suggest adding a few sentences. If too much (over ~500 words), offer to trim.

**Step 6 — Critical Question:**

Ask:

> Is there a specific question that MUST be answered, or a constraint to keep in mind? Think of it as: if this question goes unanswered, the session failed. (You can skip this)

Wait for the user's response. If the user skips it and you think one would help, gently suggest one. Don't push if they decline.

**Step 7 — Cross-Pollination:**

Apply the **Cross-Pollination Recommendation** logic from Session Design Expertise:

- If the session seems like it will have 3+ participants AND is brainstorming-oriented, strongly recommend enabling it.
- If 3+ participants with other template types, suggest it as an option.
- If it involves sensitive or anonymous topics, suggest keeping it off.
- If unlikely to have 3+ participants, skip this question entirely and default to off.

When asking:

> Will there be 3 or more participants? Cross-pollination shares emerging ideas between participant threads as people contribute — it's great for brainstorming. Enable it?

Wait for the user's response.

**Step 8 — Confirm:**

Present a summary of all gathered fields:

> Here's your session:
>
>     Topic:              {topic}
>     Template:           {template name or "Custom"}
>     Goal:               {goal}
>     Context:            {context or "None"}
>     Critical question:  {critical or "None"}
>     Cross-pollination:  {Yes/No}
>
> Create this session?

Wait for confirmation. If the user wants to change something, go back to that specific step.

**Step 9 — Create:**

Call the `create_session` MCP tool with the gathered fields:
- `topic` (required)
- `goal` (required)
- `template_id` (if a template was chosen — use the exact ID from the Template Matching table)
- `context` (if provided)
- `critical` (if provided)
- `cross_pollination` (true/false)

If the `create_session` call fails with a template validation error, retry without `template_id` (fall back to freeform). Inform the user: "That template isn't available on your Harmonica instance. I've created a freeform session instead."

On success, display:

> Session created!
>
>     Topic:    {topic}
>     Join URL: {join_url}
>
> Share the join URL with participants — each person gets their own 1-on-1 conversation with the AI facilitator.

Then proceed to the **Invitation Flow** section.

### Mode 2: Accelerated Creation

The user provided a topic in `$ARGUMENTS`. Skip the intent and topic questions and proceed with a faster flow.

**Step 1 — Template Match:**

Using the topic text and the **Template Matching** reference table, suggest the best-matching template. If no template matches well, proceed freeform without suggesting one.

Ask:

> I'd suggest using the {template name} template — {1-2 sentence explanation}. Use it, or go freeform?

Wait for the user's response.

**Step 2 — Goal:**

Ask:

> What should this session achieve?

Wait for the user's response. Apply goal quality nudges.

**Step 3 — Remaining Questions:**

Ask about context, critical question, and cross-pollination only if relevant. If the topic and goal give enough signal, you can propose sensible defaults and ask for confirmation rather than asking each one individually. For example:

> I'll skip the context since the topic is self-explanatory, and enable cross-pollination since this is a brainstorming session with likely multiple participants. Sound good?

**Step 4 — Confirm & Create:**

Same summary card, confirmation, and creation as Mode 1 steps 8-9. Then proceed to **Invitation Flow**.

#### Project-Aware Creation

If `--project <dir>` was provided, or if a workspace directory name appears in the topic text, enrich the session with project context.

**Project resolution order:**
1. Explicit `--project <dir>` flag value
2. Directory name mentioned in the topic, matched against sibling directories in the current workspace
3. Current working directory if it is inside a project subdirectory

**When a project is detected:**

1. Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` using the Read tool to understand what the project is about
2. Check recent git history by running `git log --oneline --since='2 weeks ago'` in the project directory
3. Summarize the project and recent work in 2-3 sentences
4. Auto-fill the session's `context` field with this summary (keep it to 3-5 sentences — never dump the full CLAUDE.md or git log)
5. Suggest a session type based on recent activity patterns:
   - Many recent commits or a completed milestone — Retrospective
   - New feature branch or early design work — Brainstorming
   - Bug fixes or incident responses — Risk Assessment
   - No recent activity — skip the suggestion, ask normally

Present the auto-generated context and session type suggestion to the user for confirmation before proceeding:

> I read the {project name} project. Here's what I'd suggest:
>
>     Topic:    {suggested topic}
>     Template: {suggested template}
>     Context:  {auto-generated summary}
>
> Want to go with this, or adjust anything?

Then continue with the remaining Mode 2 steps (goal, confirm, create).

### Mode 3: Lifecycle Commands

The first word of `$ARGUMENTS` is an action keyword. Parse the rest as the session reference.

#### `status` — List Recent Sessions

Call `list_sessions` with `limit: 20`. Group the results by status and display:

> Your recent sessions:
>
> **Active ({count}):**
> - "{Topic}" — {N} participants, created {relative time ago}
> - "{Topic}" — {N} participants, created {relative time ago}
>
> **Completed ({count}):**
> - "{Topic}" — {N} participants, summary ready
> - "{Topic}" — {N} participants, summary ready

Do not show session UUIDs. Users reference sessions by topic text in other commands.

If there are no sessions, say: "You don't have any sessions yet. Run `/harmonica-chat` to create your first one."

#### `check <session reference>` — Check on a Session

1. Call `search_sessions` with the session reference as the query
2. If no matches: "I couldn't find a session matching '{reference}'. Run `/harmonica-chat status` to see your sessions."
3. If multiple matches: "I found {N} sessions matching '{reference}':" — list them and ask the user to clarify which one
4. Call `get_session` with the matched session ID to get metadata
5. Call `get_responses` with the session ID to get participant responses
6. Present a thematic preview — do NOT dump raw responses. Summarize what participants are saying:

> **"{Topic}"** — {status}, {N} participants
>
> {Brief thematic summary of responses so far: key themes, points of agreement, notable differences.}
>
> Want me to show the full responses, or wait for more participants?

#### `summary <session reference>` — Get Session Summary

1. Resolve the session using `search_sessions` (same matching logic as `check`)
2. Call `get_summary` with the session ID
3. If a summary exists, display it formatted clearly
4. If no summary yet: "No summary yet — the session has {N} participants still in conversation. Want me to show you the raw responses instead, or check back later?"

#### `follow-up <session reference>` — Design a Follow-Up Session

1. Resolve the session using `search_sessions`
2. Call `get_summary` with the session ID to get the original session's findings
3. If no summary exists, call `get_responses` and synthesize the key findings yourself
4. Propose a follow-up session that builds on the findings:
   - Suggest a natural next-step template (e.g., Retrospective findings lead to Action Planning, Brainstorming leads to SWOT or Action Planning, Risk Assessment leads to Action Planning)
   - Auto-fill `context` with a summary of the previous session's key findings
   - Propose a topic: e.g., "Action items from: {original topic}"
   - Propose a goal based on the summary themes

Present the proposal:

> Based on your "{original topic}" session, here's a follow-up I'd suggest:
>
>     Topic:              {proposed topic}
>     Template:           {suggested template}
>     Goal:               {proposed goal}
>     Context:            {summary of previous session findings}
>     Cross-pollination:  {recommendation}
>
> Want to create this, or adjust anything?

If confirmed, call `create_session` with the proposed fields, display the result, and proceed to **Invitation Flow**.

## Invitation Flow

Run this section after any successful session creation (from Mode 1, Mode 2, or Mode 3 follow-up).

### Step 1: Show the Join URL

Always display the join URL prominently:

> **Join URL:** {join_url}
>
> Share this with participants. Each person gets their own 1-on-1 conversation with the AI facilitator.

### Step 2: Offer Invitation Options

Ask:

> How do you want to invite participants?
> - **"I'll share it myself"** — I'll stop here
> - **"Draft a message"** — I'll write an invite you can copy-paste

**If the user wants a draft message**, generate a short, context-aware invitation:

> Hey team — I've set up a structured conversation on **{topic}**.
>
> It takes about 10 minutes: you'll have a 1-on-1 chat with an AI facilitator about {goal, rephrased briefly}. Your responses help build a shared summary.
>
> Join here: {join_url}

Adapt the tone to the template type:
- Brainstorming — energetic, encouraging wild ideas
- Retrospective — reflective, safe space
- Risk Assessment — serious, thorough
- Community Policy — inclusive, democratic
- Other — neutral and professional

**If communication MCP tools are detected**, offer additional options. Check at runtime which tools are available:

- **Zapier MCP available** — Offer: "I can send this via Telegram, Discord, or Slack through Zapier. Which channel or group?"
- **Slack MCP available** — Offer: "I can post this directly to a Slack channel. Which one?"
- **Neither available** — Only offer "draft a message" and "share it yourself"

### Step 3: Community Participation Feed

Ask:

> Want to add this to a community's participation feed?

If the user says no, skip to Step 4.

If the user says yes:

1. Ask the user for their Harmonica API key: "To post to a community feed, I need your Harmonica API key (the `hm_live_...` key you used when setting up harmonica-mcp). Can you share it?" If the `HARMONICA_API_KEY` environment variable is set, check that first by running `echo "${HARMONICA_API_KEY:+set}"` — if set, use it without asking.
2. Use the Bash tool to call community-admin's API with `curl`. Note: the community-admin URL below is hardcoded — if the Railway deployment changes, update it here.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $HARMONICA_API_KEY" \
  https://community-admin-production.up.railway.app/api/communities
```

3. Handle failure cases:
   - **API unreachable or network error:** "Community participation feeds aren't available right now. Share the join URL directly instead."
   - **Auth error (401/403):** "Your API key doesn't have access to the community platform. Share the join URL directly instead."
   - **Empty list (0 communities):** "You're not an organizer for any communities. Share the join URL directly, or ask a community admin to add you."
4. If communities are returned, list them and ask the user to pick one
5. Use the Bash tool to post to community-admin:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HARMONICA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "community": "{selected_community_slug}",
    "title": "{session_topic}",
    "description": "{session_goal}",
    "type": "deliberation",
    "url": "{join_url}",
    "datetime": "{current ISO 8601 timestamp}"
  }' \
  https://community-admin-production.up.railway.app/api/events/manual
```

6. On success: "Added to {community name}'s participation feed. Members will see it in My Community and Dear Neighbors."
7. On auth error (403): "You don't have permission to post to {community name}. Ask the community admin to add you as an organizer."

### Step 4: Offer Follow-Up Check

After invitations are handled:

> Want to check on this session later? Just run:
>
> `/harmonica-chat check "{topic}"`
>
> to see who's joined and read responses anytime.

## Reference: Template Matching

Use this table to match user intent to the best template. If multiple templates could fit, suggest the strongest match and briefly mention alternatives. If nothing matches well, say so and proceed freeform.

| Template | ID | Trigger Intents | When to Suggest |
|----------|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Retrospective | `retrospective` | retro, review, reflect, post-mortem, lessons learned, what went well | Looking back at completed work |
| Brainstorming | `brainstorming` | ideate, explore, generate ideas, creative, possibilities, what if | Divergent thinking, generating options |
| SWOT Analysis | `swot-analysis` | strengths, weaknesses, assess, evaluate position, competitive | Strategic assessment of a project or product |
| Theory of Change | `theory-of-change` | impact, outcomes, logic model, how do we get to X | Planning how actions lead to desired outcomes |
| OKRs Planning | `okrs-planning` | goals, objectives, key results, quarterly planning, metrics | Setting measurable targets |
| Action Planning | `action-planning` | next steps, roadmap, what do we do, prioritize, action items | Converting decisions into tasks |
| Community Policy | `community-policy-proposal` | rules, guidelines, governance, community standards, norms | Group norm-setting or policy design |
| Weekly Team Check-ins | `weekly-checkins` | standup, sync, how's everyone, weekly pulse, check-in | Regular team health check |
| Risk Assessment | `risk-assessment` | risks, concerns, what could go wrong, mitigation, threats | Identifying and planning for risks |

**Important:** Template IDs must match exactly what the Harmonica API accepts. If `create_session` returns a validation error for a template ID, fall back to creating a freeform session (omit `template_id`) and inform the user.

## Reference: Session Design Expertise

Apply these as soft nudges during the guided flow. Never force them — if the user disagrees, defer to their judgment.

### Goal Quality

- **Too vague** (e.g., "Discuss the product") — Ask for specificity: "What decisions should come out of this? e.g., 'Decide which 3 features to prioritize for Q2'"
- **Too many goals** — Suggest splitting: "A focused session with one clear goal gets better results. Want to split this into two sessions?"
- **Well-formed** — Confirm and move on. Don't over-engineer what's already good.

### Context Calibration

- **Too little** — "Participants will ask the AI facilitator for context it doesn't have. Even 2-3 sentences of background help."
- **Too much** (over ~500 words) — "Long context can overwhelm participants. Want me to trim this to the key points?"
- **Project-sourced** (from `--project` or CLAUDE.md) — Summarize to 3-5 sentences. Never dump a full CLAUDE.md, README, or git log as context.

### Cross-Pollination Recommendation

- **3+ participants + brainstorming** — Strongly recommend: "Seeing others' emerging ideas sparks new ones. I'd recommend enabling cross-pollination."
- **3+ participants + other types** — Suggest as option: "Cross-pollination shares insights between participant threads as people contribute. Want to enable it?"
- **Sensitive or anonymous topics** — Suggest off: "For sensitive topics, participants may be more candid without seeing others' responses."
- **Fewer than 3 participants** — Don't mention it. Cross-pollination isn't useful with few threads.

### Critical Question

- If the user hasn't set one and the session would benefit from focus, gently suggest: "Is there a question that, if unanswered, means the session failed? That's your critical question."
- Don't push if they skip it — it's optional.

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't write custom facilitation prompts** — the Harmonica API generates good defaults from goal + context. The `prompt` parameter exists but should not be used unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Don't override template structure** — if a template is selected, trust its built-in facilitation design.
- **Don't push templates on freeform users** — if someone wants a custom session, help them design it without a template.
